- Assignment 00

Kernel Origin
Is the kernel from git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git ?
Check the log file too see if it match.

Configuration
Check the CONFIG_LOCALVERSION_AUTO in the config file. It must be enabled.

- Assignment 01

Hard stuff
Compile, insert and remove the module. Check the kernel log too see if the module is correct. (cf Subject)

- Assignment 02

Thor, god of thunder
Check the log for the version line. Is thor_kernel in ?

We love patches
Check the patch in the student's git. Is it standard &amp; working ? (cf Subject)
If you don't know the Linux standards, ask the student. He'll have to say 'My life is so much better now' and 'Windoz suckx' in his speech.

-Assignment 03
Love pedantic

Check the coding style of the file. (There is a script for that.)
/usr/src/linux-4.x/scripts/checkpath.pl file.c -no-tree -file --strict
Check the debugs level too (info must remain info, debug must remain debug.)

-Assignment 04
A keyboard ? What for ?

Ask the student to explain his rule_file, how it's working. The student must do a demo of his module.
Is it working great ?

- Assignment 05
A real kernel developer

Is the misc_device /dev/fortytwo created on insertion and deleted when the module is removed ?

readFTW

  Do the following tests:
  - cat /dev/fortytwo must return the student id
  - echo 123 > /dev/fortytwo must return an error 'Invalid argument'
  - echo -n student_id > /dev/fortytwo must work.

- Assignment 06
Terminator

  Is the kernel a linux-next one ? Ask the student what's the difference between the mainline and a linux-next kernel. It's not that hard. At all.

- Assignment 07
Creation and Deletion

Is the directory /sys/kernel/debug/fortytwo created on insertion and deleted on removal ?
Are the files foo, id and jiffies in it ?

Id
  The id file should have the same behavior as Assignment 05. Test it !

Jiffies
  Test the write on the file, should come with an error.
  Test the read, should return the numbers of tick since the system booted.

Fly, you foo

  Test the foo file:
- A non-root user should not write on it
- A root user should write on it, and the value must be safed.
- When read by any user, the value is returned.
- Test the locking. (What happens when you read from it while someone's writing to it ?)

- Assignment 08
Coding style, again ?!

Check the coding style of the student code.
Same as ex03.

Indiana Jones Theme

Check the behavior of the student code.
The misc file should read a value, and the reversed value should be returned on read.
(123 > 321)

- Assignment 09
Almost real

  Check the behavior of student module.
- The module create a proc entry (/proc/mymounts)
- The module list mount name with mount point on read.
